Development README: Installation Instructions for Development and Testing.

To install this package and get it running, these are the steps you must follow.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Required tools

a. Make sure you have python 3.5+ installed (and this is the default python,
    so you can call it from the command line like: python <command>

b. Make sure you have mongodb installed. This can be installed different ways
    on different systems. Instructions for the installation/launch are given at:
    https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community


------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. Project package storage

Change into a directory that you want to store the project.
For me, this is my projects directory, so i'd do this*:

cd /users/rberkheimer/projects

(but you can go to any path that you want these repos to live)

*Note: you must have read, write and execute access to this directory.


------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. Retrieving the project packages

Check out the following projects like so
(you can copy and paste these three commands)*:


git clone https://github.com/RBerkheimer/pythoncommons.git

git clone https://github.com/RBerkheimer/mars.git

git clone https://github.com/RBerkheimer/harness.git


------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. Project package installation

Each repository that was cloned in step (3) must now be installed.
To do this,

a. move into the directory where the project was cloned
    (eg, /users/rberkheimer/projects/harness)
b. copy and paste the following command*:

python setup.py install

*Note: you may need sudo to do steps 4 and 5 if python is installed as root.
in this case, instead of the above, while in the repository directory,
you would type (or copy/paste):

sudo python setup.py install


This must be done for each of the three packages.
They are not in the python package index (yet).


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. Install other python project dependencies

the project relies on the following external packages:

pymongo
flask
simplejson
geojson

These should be automatically installed via installation (they are added to build deps).
If, however, they aren't and/or cannot be found (like if you use conda), you'll have to install them yourself.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Starting the project server

After package install, to run the software, cd into the harness directory.
From your {projects} directory, type:

cd {projects}/{clone directory}/harness/src/main/controller

(where {clone directory} is the directory you cloned the project in,
i.e. harness, mars, pha_test_harness, pythoncommons, etc.)

Once in the controller directory, copy and paste (or type) the following:

python project_controller.py

This will start the python server on port 8008,
with static resources (for development) hosted on port 8018.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. Example system setup

To install the test system and ensure the project is working (for development),
you MUST go to this address *before* the normal application will work.
Copy/paste the following into the browser before navigating to the default page:*


http://localhost:8008/test_setup


This should take less than a minute to clone relevant test harnesses,
add components, functions, structures, and workflows, and run workflow tests.
If it is successful, you should see a block of text in browser that looks something like:


[{"_id": "57bf27507b1e8d02968bfd19", "output_coordinate_2": {"latitude": -28.172262693592074,
"longitude": -17.75771197276336},"output_coordinate_1": {"latitude": -87.72934678275715, "longitude", ...

The console/terminal should display the output of all tests.

*Note: this command can be run at any time to put the system back into this test state.

 8. System launch

 Once step 7 is successful, you should be able to navigate to

 http://localhost:8008/
